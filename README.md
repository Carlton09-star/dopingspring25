This project was made in the first half of 2025 for my research project involving Rose-Hulman's Boron doping process in order to more easily collect and store data in one place as well as ensuring all needed information gets collected when doing tests.

any lists of numbers should be put inside brackets []

When adding new standard tempertures put the positive variants in and only input a maximum of five tempertures. 
example:
If I frequently use 10 micro amps 100 micro amps and 1 milliamp as testing currents I would input
[10,100,1000] to store the new setting.
